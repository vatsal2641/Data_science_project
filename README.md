## 🔍 Visual Analysis

### 1. **Scatter Plot**
- **Purpose:** To analyze the correlation between the **pass percentage of Class 10th** and the **Quality Index**.
- **Insight:** The plot reveals a **positive correlation** — higher quality indices tend to correspond with higher pass percentages, indicating that better educational quality leads to improved results.

### 2. **Box Plot**
- **Purpose:** To visualize the **distribution of pass percentages** for Classes 10th and 12th.
- **Insight:**  
  - The box plot highlights the **mean**, **25th**, and **75th percentiles** (1st standard deviation range).  
  - It shows that **Class 12th** has a higher average pass percentage compared to **Class 10th**.  
  - The data distribution clearly suggests better performance at the higher secondary level.

### 3. **Bar Plot**
- **Purpose:** To compare **district-wise pass percentages** of students.
